ECMWF Web API Home
https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/WEBAPI
ECMWF WebAPI is a set of services developed by ECMWF to allow users from the outside to access some internal features and data of the centre. 
In this page you will find explanations, guides and examples showing how to use the different ECMWF WebAPI services.

This external access is limited and managed by the User Profile access (Member State, Commercial customers, ECMWF staff member...). Some of these services are public and some other are restricted to the Archive Access.

## Getting Started

### Copernicous

[Copernicus](https://www.copernicus.eu/en/about-copernicus) is the European Union's Earth Observation Programme, looking at our planet and its environment for the ultimate benefit of all European citizens. It offers information services based on satellite Earth Observation and in situ (non-space) data.

#### Access to Data
[Web Site](https://www.copernicus.eu/en/access-data)

Copernicus builds on a constellations of satellites making millions an impressive number of of daily observations, as well as on a global network of thousands of land-, air- and marine-based sensors to create the most detailed pictures of Earth. The technological evolution, especially in terms of availability and accessibility, has made Copernicus the largest space data provider in the world, currently producing 12 terabytes per day.

The vast majority of data and information delivered by the Copernicus Space infrastructure and the Copernicus services are made available and accessible to any citizen and any organisation around the world on a free, full and open access basis. You can access Copernicus Data and Information Services through the DIAS or the Conventional Data Hubs.


#### Copernicus Data and Information Services  (DIAS)
[Web Site](https://www.copernicus.eu/en/access-data/dias)
To facilitate and standardise access to data, the European Commission has funded the deployment of five cloud-based platforms  providing  centralised  access  to  Copernicus  data  and  information,  as  well as to processing tools. These platforms are known as the DIAS, or Data and Information Access Services.

The five DIAS online platforms allow users to discover, manipulate, process and download Copernicus data and information. All DIAS platforms provide access to Copernicus Sentinel data, as well as to the information products from Copernicus’ six operational services, together with cloud-based tools (open source and/or on a pay-per-use basis).

Each of the five competitive platforms also provides access to additional commercial satellite or non-space data sets as well as premium offers in terms of support or priority. Thanks to a single access point for the entire Copernicus data and information, DIAS allows the users to develop and host their own applications in the cloud, while removing the need to download bulky files from several access points and process them locally.

 - **All-in-one Access** : The five DIAS online platforms allow users to discover, manipulate, process and download Copernicus data and information. Each platform provides access to the full set of Copernicus data and information, as well as the ability to process and combine it with data from other sources (space and non-space). Their cloud-based systems architecture performs the heavy lifting on the back end, so users get coherent and analysis-ready information on the front end. Because the DIAS platforms are providing mass storage and handling of data, users can begin using information from a single entry point
 - **A wealth of services** : All DIAS platforms provide access to Copernicus Sentinel data, as well as to the information products from Copernicus’ six operational services, together with cloud-based tools (open source and/or on a pay-per-use basis). Each of the five competitive platforms also provides access to additional commercial satellite or non-space data sets as well as premium offers in terms of support or priority. Thanks to a single access point for the entire Copernicus data and information, DIAS allows the users to develop and host new applications in the cloud, while removing the need to download bulky files from several access points and process them locally. 
 - **User Focused** : Each DIAS consortium runs its own back office where all storage and computing are performed. These back offices are the starting point for the development of a front office and third-party applications. This chain, starting with the back office and ending with the users, generates a flow of information that transforms hard data into useful services for society and businesses. This unique, ground-breaking model lowers the barriers to entry for users, enabling them to build applications and to unleash the full potential of Copernicus data and information
 - **A world of Opportunities** : The DIAS architecture, as exemplified hereunder, enables further extraction of value from Copernicus data and information and increases the ease with which it is handled. While boosting opportunities for start-ups and developers, the DIAS platforms offer a complement to existing data access portals that will continue to operate. The competition between the five DIAS providers prompts quality service and emulation, thus benefitting the end-user. Thanks to these platforms, the ambitious initiative set up by the European Commission to consolidate and simplify access to Copernicus data and information is going one step further and serving public authorities, industry, data users and the public, who are the ultimate beneficiaries of Copernicus.
  

#### Conventional Data Hubs

#### Services 

 - [Atmosphere](https://www.copernicus.eu/services/atmosphere) : We provide consistent and quality-controlled information related to air pollution and health, solar energy, greenhouse gases and climate forcing, everywhere in the world.

##### Atmosphere


The Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service ([CAMS](https://www.copernicus.eu/en/services/atmosphere)) provides continuous data and information on atmospheric composition. 

The service describes the current situation, forecasts the situation a few days ahead, and analyses consistently retrospective data records for recent years. 

The Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service supports many applications in a variety of domains including health, environmental monitoring, renewable energies, meteorology and climatology. 

The service focuses on five main areas:

 - Air quality and atmospheric composition; 
 - Ozone layer and ultra-violet radiation; 
 - Emissions and surface fluxes; 
 - Solar radiation; 
 - Climate forcing.
  
Here are presented a few application examples of the service ([more examples here](https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/what-we-do?q=what-cams-used)).

It provides daily information on the global atmospheric composition by monitoring and forecasting constituents such as greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide and methane), reactive gases (e.g.  carbon monoxide, oxidised nitrogen compounds, sulphur dioxide), ozone and aerosols. 

It provides near-real-time analysis and 4-day forecasts, as well as reanalysis, of the European air quality, thus enabling a permanent assessment of the air we breathe.  

It provides public and private organisations involved in solar energy usage with suitable and accurate information on the solar radiation resources at the Earth's surface, which is of major importance in domains like health, agriculture and renewable energies. 

 

For a more detailed presentation of the Copernicus Atmospherere Monitoring Service, please refer to the attached factsheet and the [service website](https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/).
