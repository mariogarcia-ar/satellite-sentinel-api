## Getting Started

### Copernicous

[Copernicus](https://www.copernicus.eu/en/about-copernicus) is the European Union's Earth Observation Programme, looking at our planet and its environment for the ultimate benefit of all European citizens. It offers information services based on satellite Earth Observation and in situ (non-space) data.

#### Access to Data
[Web Site](https://www.copernicus.eu/en/access-data)

Copernicus builds on a constellations of satellites making millions an impressive number of of daily observations, as well as on a global network of thousands of land-, air- and marine-based sensors to create the most detailed pictures of Earth. The technological evolution, especially in terms of availability and accessibility, has made Copernicus the largest space data provider in the world, currently producing 12 terabytes per day.

The vast majority of data and information delivered by the Copernicus Space infrastructure and the Copernicus services are made available and accessible to any citizen and any organisation around the world on a free, full and open access basis. You can access Copernicus Data and Information Services through the DIAS or the Conventional Data Hubs.


#### Copernicus Data and Information Services  (DIAS)
[Web Site](https://www.copernicus.eu/en/access-data/dias)
To facilitate and standardise access to data, the European Commission has funded the deployment of five cloud-based platforms  providing  centralised  access  to  Copernicus  data  and  information,  as  well as to processing tools. These platforms are known as the DIAS, or Data and Information Access Services.

The five DIAS online platforms allow users to discover, manipulate, process and download Copernicus data and information. All DIAS platforms provide access to Copernicus Sentinel data, as well as to the information products from Copernicus’ six operational services, together with cloud-based tools (open source and/or on a pay-per-use basis).

Each of the five competitive platforms also provides access to additional commercial satellite or non-space data sets as well as premium offers in terms of support or priority. Thanks to a single access point for the entire Copernicus data and information, DIAS allows the users to develop and host their own applications in the cloud, while removing the need to download bulky files from several access points and process them locally.

 - **All-in-one Access** : The five DIAS online platforms allow users to discover, manipulate, process and download Copernicus data and information. Each platform provides access to the full set of Copernicus data and information, as well as the ability to process and combine it with data from other sources (space and non-space). Their cloud-based systems architecture performs the heavy lifting on the back end, so users get coherent and analysis-ready information on the front end. Because the DIAS platforms are providing mass storage and handling of data, users can begin using information from a single entry point
 - **A wealth of services** : All DIAS platforms provide access to Copernicus Sentinel data, as well as to the information products from Copernicus’ six operational services, together with cloud-based tools (open source and/or on a pay-per-use basis). Each of the five competitive platforms also provides access to additional commercial satellite or non-space data sets as well as premium offers in terms of support or priority. Thanks to a single access point for the entire Copernicus data and information, DIAS allows the users to develop and host new applications in the cloud, while removing the need to download bulky files from several access points and process them locally. 
 - **User Focused** : Each DIAS consortium runs its own back office where all storage and computing are performed. These back offices are the starting point for the development of a front office and third-party applications. This chain, starting with the back office and ending with the users, generates a flow of information that transforms hard data into useful services for society and businesses. This unique, ground-breaking model lowers the barriers to entry for users, enabling them to build applications and to unleash the full potential of Copernicus data and information
 - **A world of Opportunities** : The DIAS architecture, as exemplified hereunder, enables further extraction of value from Copernicus data and information and increases the ease with which it is handled. While boosting opportunities for start-ups and developers, the DIAS platforms offer a complement to existing data access portals that will continue to operate. The competition between the five DIAS providers prompts quality service and emulation, thus benefitting the end-user. Thanks to these platforms, the ambitious initiative set up by the European Commission to consolidate and simplify access to Copernicus data and information is going one step further and serving public authorities, industry, data users and the public, who are the ultimate beneficiaries of Copernicus.
  

#### Conventional Data Hubs
[Web Site](https://www.copernicus.eu/en/access-data/conventional-data-access-hubs)

The vast majority of data and information delivered by the Copernicus space infrastructure and the Copernicus services are made freely available and accessible to any citizen and any organisation around the world.


Satellite data

 - **ESA** : 
   - [SCI Hub](https://scihub.copernicus.eu/) : The Copernicus Open Access Hub (previously known as Sentinels Scientific Data Hub) provides complete, free and open access to Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, Sentinel-3 and **Sentinel-5P** user products, starting from the In-Orbit Commissioning Review(IOCR). Sentinel Data are also available via the Copernicus Data and Information Access Services (DIAS) through several [platforms](https://scihub.copernicus.eu/twiki/do/view/SciHubWebPortal/WebHome#dias-box) .
   - [CSCDA](https://spacedata.copernicus.eu/web/cscda/home) : This Portal presents the services offered within the Copernicus Space Component Data Access system (CSCDA) context. It explains the user's eligibility, [data offer](https://spacedata.copernicus.eu/web/cscda/data-offer), data access mechanism and user support and is the entry point to the Copernicus User's Personal Area. Further to this, the Portal provides full visibility of all Copernicus Contributing Missions (CCMs) and the status of data provision. Information about the Copernicus Sentinel dedicated missions are instead available in [Sentinel Online](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/), whilst data access is available to all from the [Copernicus Open Access Hub](https://scihub.copernicus.eu/).
 - **EUMETSAT** : 
   - [EUMETCast](https://www.eumetsat.int/website/home/Data/DataDelivery/EUMETCast/index.html) : EUMETCast is a multi-service dissemination system based on multicast technology. It uses commercial telecommunication geostationary satellites using DVB standards and research networks to multi-cast files (data and products) to a wide user community. EUMETCast also delivers a range of third-party products.
   - [CODA](https://coda.eumetsat.int/#/home) : 


##### Two access points to Copernicus satellite data are managed by ESA:

###### Copernicus Open Access Hub

Previously known as Sentinels Scientific Data Hub, the portal provides access to Sentinel data through an interactive graphical user interface. The portal will also provide access to data produced by future Sentinel missions when available.

###### Copernicus Space Component Data Access (CSCDA)

The portal provides access to the Copernicus collaborative ground segment. Anyone can view and discover data, but downloading images is restricted to public authorities, European projects and Copernicus services.

 

##### Two access points to Copernicus satellite data are managed by EUMETSAT:

###### EUMETCast

Any environmental data, of any format, can be distributed through EUMETCast. The platform delivers more than 380 different product collections, including EUMETSAT’s own satellite data, Copernicus marine and atmosphere data, and a wide range of third-party products.

###### Copernicus Online Data Access  (CODA)

The Sentinel-3 CODA (Copernicus Online Data Access) Web Service provides free and open access to Sentinel-3 products through a 12 months rolling archive with access to Level 1 and Level 2 Marine data in different latency modes (Near Real-Time, Short Time Critical, Non Time Critical). Access is provided either through CODA user interface or through CODA APIs.  Both user interface and APIs allow users to set different parameters (geographic area, time, type of product etc) to refine their search in the archive of products. In case users need data older than one year, it is possible to use the EUMETSAT Data Centre.

#### Services

##### Atmosphere


The Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service ([CAMS](https://www.copernicus.eu/en/services/atmosphere)) provides continuous data and information on atmospheric composition. 

The service describes the current situation, forecasts the situation a few days ahead, and analyses consistently retrospective data records for recent years. 

The Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service supports many applications in a variety of domains including health, environmental monitoring, renewable energies, meteorology and climatology. 

The service focuses on five main areas:

 - Air quality and atmospheric composition; 
 - Ozone layer and ultra-violet radiation; 
 - Emissions and surface fluxes; 
 - Solar radiation; 
 - Climate forcing.
  
Here are presented a few application examples of the service ([more examples here](https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/what-we-do?q=what-cams-used)).

It provides daily information on the global atmospheric composition by monitoring and forecasting constituents such as greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide and methane), reactive gases (e.g.  carbon monoxide, oxidised nitrogen compounds, sulphur dioxide), ozone and aerosols. 

It provides near-real-time analysis and 4-day forecasts, as well as reanalysis, of the European air quality, thus enabling a permanent assessment of the air we breathe.  

It provides public and private organisations involved in solar energy usage with suitable and accurate information on the solar radiation resources at the Earth's surface, which is of major importance in domains like health, agriculture and renewable energies. 

 

For a more detailed presentation of the Copernicus Atmospherere Monitoring Service, please refer to the attached factsheet and the [service website](https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/).
